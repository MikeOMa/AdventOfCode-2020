# AdventOfCode-2020
https://adventofcode.com/ Haivng a go at advent of code!
They give a coding challenge every day (two parts) and ask you to solve it.

I'll post up all of my solutions here (with very little/no commenting). 
I'm writing 1 script per challenge so this will just be one massive messy directory. 
I'm going for a get it done quickly approach rather than efficient/tidy code.  

If anyone is considering doing it, I would recommend.
The challenges are really well thought out. I use it as a morning brain teaser.
