# AdventOfCode-2020
https://adventofcode.com/ Haivng a go at advent of code!
They give a coding challenge every day (two parts) and ask you to solve it.

I'll post up all of my solutions here (with very little/no commenting). 
I'm writing 1 script per challenge so this will just be one massive messy directory. 
I'm going for a get it done quickly approach rather than efficient/tidy code.  

If anyone is considering doing it, I would recommend.
The challenges are really well thought out. I use it as a morning brain teaser.


### It is over!

It's finished, I managed to do every day. I will definitely be participating next year again. Thanks to Eric Wastl for making these great challenges!!

Think my highlight of the challenge was coding up day 23. My initial solution used pop and insert. For the second part of the challenge my code would've taken about 8 hours to run. After learning that linked lists were a good way to shuffle the list for this problem, the solution only took about 20 seconds to run.

In the extremely unlikely event you've seen anything here and have questions just get in touch!
